title: The Juicer Silencer
---

Your modern juicer can turn your bowling ball into a smoothy. But even when youâ€™re just mashing bananaâ€™s your juicer is LOUD! The Juicer Silencer is the solution. Itâ€™s a simple case that turns your little jet engine into a catâ€™s purr.  
Nice slick white plastic side walls and clear bullet-proof front partner with neoprene inside panels to make being heathy quieter. Simply slip it over the top and slip it off when youâ€™re done. One second from waking that deaf old neighbor five doors down to letting your kids sleep in. Itâ€™s that easy. Just $155 with a lifetime guarantee. Easy to use, simple to clean. Easy to store but attractive enough to just keep on the counter. You wonâ€™t even know itâ€™s there ðŸ™‚ My wife thinks it looks better than the juicer!  

Custom made in California. If you have a weird sized blender or juicer or want the Juicer Silencer to fit under your cabinet, send us dimensions and weâ€™ll customize one just for you for an addition $20.  

As it is it fits the Nutribullet, Vitamix, etc. Questions? Call CompetitiveSwimmer.com at 800.999.0824.
